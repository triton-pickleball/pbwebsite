# Security Analysis: GitHub Actions + API Keys

## üö® THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM

**GitHub Actions + Secrets = STILL INSECURE for client-side API keys**

### What Happens with GitHub Actions + Secrets:

1. **GitHub Actions runs during build:**
   ```yaml
   - name: Build with secrets
     env:
       GOOGLE_CALENDAR_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.GOOGLE_CALENDAR_API_KEY }}
     run: npm run build
   ```

2. **Build process injects API key into JavaScript:**
   ```javascript
   // This gets built into your static files
   const apiKey = "AIzaSyBxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"; // EXPOSED!
   ```

3. **Built files are served to users:**
   - User visits your website
   - Browser downloads JavaScript files
   - **API key is visible in source code**
   - Anyone can inspect and steal your API key

## üîç PROOF: How Easy It Is to Steal API Keys

**Anyone can steal your API key in 30 seconds:**

1. **Right-click ‚Üí "View Page Source"**
2. **Open browser dev tools (F12)**
3. **Look at the JavaScript files**
4. **Find the API key in the code**
5. **Copy and use your API key**

## ‚úÖ SECURE SOLUTIONS

### Option 1: Google Calendar Embed (RECOMMENDED - ALREADY WORKING)
```astro
<iframe src="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=YOUR_CALENDAR_ID" />
```
- ‚úÖ **No API keys needed**
- ‚úÖ **100% secure**
- ‚úÖ **Works on GitHub Pages**
- ‚úÖ **Real-time calendar data**

### Option 2: Server-Side Proxy (Advanced)
1. **Deploy API to Vercel/Railway** with your API keys
2. **Keep main site on GitHub Pages** (static)
3. **Fetch from your secure API** (CORS-enabled)

### Option 3: Switch to Server-Side Platform
- **Vercel** - Supports server-side code + environment variables
- **Netlify** - Supports serverless functions
- **Railway/Render** - Full server support

## üéØ RECOMMENDATION

**Use the Google Calendar Embed** (Option 1) because:
- ‚úÖ **Already implemented and working**
- ‚úÖ **100% secure** - no API keys exposed
- ‚úÖ **Perfect for GitHub Pages**
- ‚úÖ **Shows real calendar data**
- ‚úÖ **No additional complexity**

## üîí SECURITY SUMMARY

**GitHub Actions + Secrets = FALSE SECURITY**
- The API key still ends up in client-side code
- Anyone can steal it by viewing your website
- This is a common security mistake

**Google Calendar Embed = TRUE SECURITY**
- No API keys needed
- No client-side exposure
- Works perfectly with static sites
