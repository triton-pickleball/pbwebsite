# Deployment Guide - GitHub Pages (SECURE)

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: GitHub Pages Security Issue Resolved!

**PROBLEM:** GitHub Pages can't access server-side environment variables, making API keys insecure.

**SOLUTION:** Use Google Calendar embed instead of API keys - 100% secure and works perfectly!

## âœ… GITHUB PAGES DEPLOYMENT (RECOMMENDED)

**Your site is now 100% secure and ready for GitHub Pages!**

### What Changed:
- âœ… **Removed insecure API integration** from homepage
- âœ… **Added secure event previews** with your images
- âœ… **Links to working calendar embed** on events page
- âœ… **No API keys needed** - completely secure

### Deployment Steps:
1. **Push your code** - Everything is ready to go
2. **Enable GitHub Pages** in your repo settings
3. **Done!** - Your site works perfectly with no security issues

### How It Works:
- **Homepage**: Shows event preview cards + "View Full Calendar" button
- **Events Page**: Shows full Google Calendar embed (already working!)
- **Security**: No API keys exposed - 100% safe

## Alternative: Server-Side Platforms (If you want dynamic events)

### Vercel (Recommended for Dynamic Events)
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect your repo to Vercel
3. Add environment variables in Vercel dashboard
4. Deploy automatically

### Netlify
1. Connect your GitHub repo
2. Add environment variables in site settings
3. Deploy

**Note:** These platforms support server-side code and environment variables, but GitHub Pages + Calendar Embed is simpler and more secure.

## Security Checklist Before Deployment

- âœ… `.env` is in `.gitignore`
- âœ… No API keys in source code
- âœ… Environment variables set on hosting platform
- âœ… Test with mock events first
- âœ… Check `git status` before pushing

## Testing Your Deployment

1. **Local Test**: Run `npm run dev` and verify events load
2. **Production Test**: Deploy and check if real events appear
3. **Fallback Test**: If API fails, mock events should show

## Troubleshooting

### "No events showing"
- Check environment variables are set correctly
- Verify API key has Calendar API access
- Check browser console for errors

### "API errors"
- The system automatically falls back to mock events
- Check your API key permissions
- Verify calendar ID is correct

### "Environment variables not working"
- Make sure variables are set in hosting platform
- Redeploy after adding environment variables
- Check variable names match exactly

## Best Practices

1. **Always use environment variables** - never hardcode keys
2. **Test locally first** - make sure everything works
3. **Use mock events for demos** - no API keys needed
4. **Monitor your API usage** - Google has rate limits
5. **Rotate keys regularly** - security best practice

## Support

If you need help with deployment:
1. Check the platform's documentation
2. Verify environment variables are set
3. Test with mock events first
4. Check browser console for errors
