# Join Page Management Guide

## üéØ How to Update Join Page Content

The join page is now **completely dynamic** and easy to customize! All join page data is stored in `/src/data/join.ts`.

## üìù Updating Form Links

### To Update the Tryout Form Link:
1. Open `/src/data/join.ts`
2. Update the `tryoutForm.url` field:

```typescript
tryoutForm: {
  url: "https://forms.google.com/your-actual-tryout-form", // Replace with real URL
  text: "Tryout Form",
  description: "Complete forms required to tryout. Tryouts are held to find new members."
}
```

### To Update the Interest Form Link:
1. Open `/src/data/join.ts`
2. Update the `interestForm.url` field:

```typescript
interestForm: {
  url: "https://forms.google.com/your-actual-interest-form", // Replace with real URL
  text: "Interest Form", 
  description: "Fill out our interest form to let us know you're interested in joining."
}
```

### To Update Other Links:
- **Discord Link**: Update `discordLink.url`
- **Schedule Link**: Update `scheduleLink.url` (use `/events` for internal links)
- **Button Text**: Update the `text` fields for any button

## üîó Supported Link Types

### External Links (Google Forms, etc.):
```typescript
url: "https://forms.google.com/your-form"
```

### Internal Links (to other pages on your site):
```typescript
url: "/events"  // Will automatically become full URL
url: "/about"  // Will automatically become full URL
```

### External Links (Discord, Instagram, etc.):
```typescript
url: "https://discord.gg/5Jsz8rKStg"
url: "https://www.instagram.com/triton.pickleball/"
```

## üìã Complete Example

Here's how your `/src/data/join.ts` might look with real form links:

```typescript
export const joinPageData: JoinPageData = {
  tryoutForm: {
    url: "https://forms.google.com/d/1ABC123DEF456GHI789JKL/formview", // Real Google Form
    text: "Tryout Form",
    description: "Complete forms required to tryout. Tryouts are held to find new members."
  },
  interestForm: {
    url: "https://forms.google.com/d/1XYZ789ABC123DEF456GHI/formview", // Real Google Form
    text: "Interest Form", 
    description: "Fill out our interest form to let us know you're interested in joining."
  },
  discordLink: {
    url: "https://discord.gg/5Jsz8rKStg",
    text: "Join Discord"
  },
  scheduleLink: {
    url: "/events", // Internal link to events page
    text: "View Schedule"
  }
};
```
